---- Notes about potential issues copyright issues 
Copyright tool run on all of the grails plugins/
=================================================== 

- The tool does a blanket replace of all copyright headers. Is this really ok?
    Tool did catch some copyright headers 'not at start of file'.
      => turns out they have //copied from comments.
       Inspected: all copied from springframework. So looks ok.
- The tool does not seem to work on .groovy files. 
   Manually checked: 
    Only .groovy files I found where in test programs for unit tests.
    These never had copyright notices. Seems ok.
