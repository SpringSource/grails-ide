/**
 * Client side counterpart of CommandInput on the remote process.
 * <p>
 * This thread is responsible for reading input from the console and sending that input to the process
 * in the format the process is expecting.
 * <p>
 * Tricky part is that console may not have any input, and thus the reading from console may
 * block indefinitely. That is annoying since it doesn't leave us with a reliable way to
 * terminate the thread doing the reading.
