/**
 * Maintains a global list of 'ignored' grails project names. A number of listeners and other tasks
 * are triggered sometimes at unexpected times. E.g. when imporiting or creating a new project
 * the GrailsProjectVersionFixer is prone to kick in before the import is actually complete, 
 * at the first change event where the project appears partially created in the workspace.
 * <p>
 * This will typically result in spurious errors and dialogs popping up because problems are detected
 * in partially created projects. These problems are typically not 'real' and eventually get fixed
 * by the process that is creating these projects.
 * <p>
 * To handle situations like that this class manages a list of 'ignorable' projects. Version checkers
 * and other similar 'reactive' verifiers should skip checking any projects in the list.
 * <p>
 * At the other end, import wizards and the like should add project names they are in the 
 * process of creating to this list, and remove them when they are done.
