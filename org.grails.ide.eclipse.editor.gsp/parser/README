The files in this directory are used to create the gsp parser, which is a variant of the jsp parser from the WST project on eclispe.org.
The repository for WST is here:
:pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/webtools

The parser generator is JFlex and a version is available on the internal SpringSource wiki:
https://wiki.springsource.com/download/attachments/29852742/jflex-1.2.2.zip
Note that the 1.2.2 version is not easy to find on the web
JFlex is a sourceforge project, but only has versions 1.3-1.4.3 in its downloads area.  So, we must keep this version around.

The skeleton.sed file contains the modified JFlex 1.2.2 skeleton file with
changes for use with the tokenizers within the org.eclipse.wst.sse.core.xml and
org.eclipse.wst.sse.core.jsp plugins.

The JSPTokenizer.jflex file is the original JSP grammar and GSPTokenizer.jflex is the modified GSP grammar.  The changes include
removing all references to EL and adding the ${...} as JSP content tags.  GSP comments are not supported yet.  

To recreate GSPTokenizer.java:
1. Download and unzip jflex from the wiki https://wiki.springsource.com/download/attachments/29852742/jflex-1.2.2.zip
2. Edit the Build GSP parser.launch delegate to point to your unzipped jflex 
3. Run the Build GSP parser.launch delegate (you might need to modify this to run on Windows).
4. Refresh the GSPTokenizer.java file
5. Replace the existing GSPTokenizer file in the source folder with the new one
